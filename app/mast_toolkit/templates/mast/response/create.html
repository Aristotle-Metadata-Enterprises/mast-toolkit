        <p>Thank you for taking the time to participate in Aristotle Metadata's survey of data asset knowledge and management.</p>
        <p>
            Your input will help us gain an understanding of how your organisation manages its data assets.
            A <b>data asset</b> is a collection of data that is developed for a broad purpose.
            This information will help your organisation recognise how data assets can be used to support strategic plans and goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            This survey should take less than ten minutes to complete.
            Weâ€™ve designed it to be as straightforward as possible, and your responses will be kept strictly confidential.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this questionnaire:
            <ul>
                <li>Your<b> team </b>is the unit you are assigned to, or the project team you spend the most time working with</li>
                <li>A <b>data asset </b>is any data file or system, and can include databases or Excel spreadsheets, but also systems that collect data such as HR systems or analytics tools</li>
                <li><b>Data documentation</b>, also known as <b>metadata</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>is information you record about a data asset so that others can understand what it contains and how they should interpret it</li>
                <li>A<b>&nbsp;data term </b>is an entry in a glossary that has a consistent meaning across the organisation, such as Staff Member, Patient, or Identifier</li>
                <li>A <b>data glossary</b>&nbsp;is a collection of business terms and their meanings related to data. It helps people understand and use data in the same way.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>A <b>data dictionary </b>is a data glossary for a single data asset; it provides a technical description of a data asset. For example, the 2021 Census dictionary contains detailed information about Census variables and concepts. The dictionary helps data users better understand and interpret Census data.</li>

        Developing a greater awareness of data assets is part of the <b>IDEAL</b> (Inventory-Document-Endorse-Audit-Leadership) Framework.
        The framework has processes that help an organisation make their data more accessible and easier to understand.
        These questions are designed to get an understanding of things you do in your role, so if a question doesn't relate to your job role or you aren't sure if you do that task select "I don't do this as part of my current role".
